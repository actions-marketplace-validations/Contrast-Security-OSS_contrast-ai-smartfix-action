"""Custom instructions loader for SmartFix.

Reads team coding standards from the repository and injects them into the
fix agent prompt. Instructions are always read from the configured base branch
via `git show`, not from the workspace filesystem, to ensure:
  - The base-branch version is always used (not a PR branch)
  - Symlink traversal attacks are impossible (no filesystem path resolution)
