## "BREAK GLASS" In case of emergency

_Compromised library:_

In the event that a library that SmartFix uses is found to be compromised (like the LiteLLM hack):
- Update `src/requirements.txt` to list an uncompromised version of the library
- Regenerate `src/requirements.lock` with `uv pip compile src/requirements.txt ... -o src/requirements.lock` and inspect it to ensure it doesn't include a compromised version
- Verify that the SmartFix workflow functions properly against one of our test applications to fix a Contrast vulnerability
- Release the updated version of SmartFix by following these instructions: https://contrast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARCH/pages/4215046180/SmartFix+Action+Releasing+notes
